I'm just testing some stuff, and using things that i learned or that i'am learning =) 

This project is a web site for sharing food recipes!

Fell free to explore my code!

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Steven-exe/foodfy) ![Status WorkInProgress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work%20in%20Progress-blueviolet)

This code is currently using:

- Nunjucks

- Nodemon

- Express

## Testing

Make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> installed!

If you want to run it:

```
npm install
```
and to start a web server:

```
npm start
```

Now go to your browser and type : http://localhost:5000

I will add more things in the future!
